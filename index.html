 <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a passionate researcher with a strong foundation in Computer Science and Data Science, currently working at the Microbiome Informatics Lab in IIIT Delhi. My academic path began with a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Techno International, Newtown (2023)(undertaken by Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology), followed by research roles at IISER Bhopal and IIT Guwahati. These experiences deepened my interest in computational approaches to health and biomedical data, especially in Machine Learning and Deep Learning for Healthcare.</p>

    <p>My research interests span Metagenomics, Bioinformatics, and Biological Data Analysis, with a growing focus on Scalable Data Science and the intersection of Computer Architecture with Computational Biology. I enjoy working in collaborative, interdisciplinary environments and am driven by the goal of developing efficient computational solutions to complex biological challenges.</p>

    <p>Beyond research, I mentor GATE aspirants in Computer Science and Data Science (https://topmate.io/debarshi_roy) and serve as a motivational speaker. My hobbies include playing cricket and chess, swimming, drama, and reading non-fiction and spiritual literature.</p>
